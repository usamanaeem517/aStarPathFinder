# aStarPathFinder
A GUI based app that finds the optimal path between two points in a maze using the A* algorithm.</br></br>

In code I have used matplotlib to display the graphics. The white box show that the point is a clear path, the red color shoes building and traffic, </br>
the blue color shows the path followed from one pointer to another. </br>
The yellow point show start point of start of the route. </br>
The green oint shown the end point of the route. </br>
A 40 X 40 grid is used for it. The grid is filled with random sequence of 0 and 1 to show roads and blockages.</br>
Simply execute the program.</br>

<pre><code>
python3 code.py
</code></pre>

The program will ask for x-axis of start point.</br>
then The program will ask for y-axis of start point.</br>
the The program will ask for x-axis of end point.</br>
the The program will ask for y-axis of end point.</br>
The its prints the path on screen.</br>
